###Introduction

Hi there, nice to meet you. 

My name is Raluca and I am a 27-years-old professional living near London.I am dedicated and results-driven, and I have a strong desire to learn everything and anything. 


###Work experience


I Currently work with an international charity that specialises in non-formal education and learning where I am responsible for the SharePoint Intranet development, data analysis, and training and support. I am also the defacto IT person :).

Previously I have worked as an Area Coordinator for large Online Retailer where I managed the day to day operation anf team of 35 to ensure a smooth running of business. 


###Education

I am a curious individual with an expensive hobby :)

-I am currently studying an MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex. 
-I have completed a BSc in Criminology and Psychology where I fell in love with Data and Statistics, and I tried to hone that by deep diving into database creatin and data analysis with SQL. 
-Before any of these I got a nursing degree where I fell in love with science. 

###Fun facts

In my free time I enjoy cooking, playing with my cats and reading highly questionable literature. My favourite book is Mrs. Beetons's Book of Household Management.
