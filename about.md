##Hi, nice to meet you. 

My name is Raluca and I am curently indulgng in my very expensive hobby by studying an MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex. 

Previously I have completed a BSc in Criminology and Psychology where I fell in love with Data and Statistics. 

I am dedicated and results-driven (i.e a bit obsessive), and I have a strong desire to learn everything and anything (my therapist believes is ADHD but I digress). 
Currently I work with an international charity that specialises in non-formal education and learning where I am responsible for the SharePoint Intranet development , data analysis, and training and support. I am also the defacto IT person :)

In my free time I enjoy cooking, playing with my cats and reading highly questionable literature
