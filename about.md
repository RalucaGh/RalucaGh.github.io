# About the main character

### Introduction:

Hi there, nice to meet you. 

My name is Raluca and I am a 27-years-old professional living near London. I am dedicated and results-driven, and I like to get my nose stuck in complex problems.  


### Work experience:


I currently work with an international charity that specialises in non-formal education and learning where I am responsible for the SharePoint Intranet development, data analysis, and training and support. I am also the defacto IT person :).

Previously I have worked as an Area Coordinator for large Online Retailer where I managed the day to day operations and a team of 35 to ensure a smooth running of business. 


### Education:

I am a curious individual that loves to learn anything and everythin. This has led to the following expensive hobby:

- I am currently studying an MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex and I dream of one day being able to understand complex Machine Learning Algorithms. 
- I have completed a BSc in Criminology and Psychology where I fell in love with Data and Statistics, and I tried to hone that by deep diving into database creation and data analysis with SQL. 
- Before any of these I got myself a nice shining nursing degree where I fell in love with science (and learnd how to fix some boo-boos)

### Fun facts:

In my free time I enjoy cooking, playing with my cats and reading highly questionable literature. My favourite book is Mrs. Beetons's Book of Household Management.
