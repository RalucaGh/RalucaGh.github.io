## Learning Outcomes 
1. Identify and manage challenges, security issues and risks, limitations and opportunities in data wrangling.
2. Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques (involving preparing, cleaning, exploring, creating, optimising and evaluating big data) to solve them.
3. Design, develop and evaluate solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems in various environments using relevant programming paradigms.
4. Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.

## Units 1-3: The data collection process

The IoT represents a paradigm shift in technology, in which everyday objects are connected to the internet. This enables data collection, analysis and interconnectedness which offers potential for innovation as well as efficiency and convenience such as automating tasks and providing real-life insights which in turn, can lead to optimising processes and increased productivity across industries. Furthermore, improved decision making is enabled by analysing the vast amounts of data that the IoT produces (Gubbi et al, 2013). This can be seen in industries such as healthcare, were remote monitoring increases patients’ outcomes (Rejeb et al., 2023). IoT also provides new opportunities of development and urban advancement such as the enabling of the development of smart cities (Batty, 2020). 

Because of the sheer volume of data gathered through the IoT, managing, maintaining, analysing and storing it is fraught with challenges. It requires specialised architectures, such as Lambada and Kappa, which pose technical challenges such as the trade-off between speed and accuracy, as well as latency, where queries take a very long time to process meaning that the analysis is not real-time, so the insights gained are not accurate (Tejada, 2020)

Furthermore, the interoperability between different IoT platforms and devices is complex, as IoT devices can use different communications protocols. This issue is further exacerbated by a combination of the complexity of IoT device and vendor lock in (Gubbi et al, 2013). An example of this is the Apple ecosystem, that offers devices ranging from household devices to laptops and phones that integrate seamlessly with each other, but interoperability with other operating systems is limited (Peterson, 2021).

The implementation of IoT presents potential risks. For example, improper access permissions can lead to data privacy violations which can affect both individuals, and companies who are using the IoT in their day-to-day work. This issue is further exacerbated by the sheer amount of data collected by the IoT devices. However, data privacy risks can be mitigated by using strong encryption, and strong access controls. Furthermore, privacy features such as minimal data collection, and user control can be implemented in the IoT system from the onset. (Shaffique, 2024)

Security threats also represent a prevalent issue to IoT systems, as multiple devices represent multiple points of access to the system. This can become an issue especially for devices with limited security measures, however cybersecurity threats can be reduced by using network segmentation, which reduces the risk of an attack spreading. (Mahmood, 2019; Meneghello et al, 2019)

Malfunctioning of sensors, network fluctuations and data inconsistencies can influence data quality, consistency and reliability coming from IoT systems, which in turn can affect informed decision-making. This can be mitigated by a combination of data validation techniques to identify errors, as well as regularly calibrating the sensors of the devices to reduce the potential of errors. (Al Mamun et al, 2019). 

In conclusion, whilst IoT provides exceptional potential for growth and innovation, it also presents a series of risks and limitations that range from cyberattacks to hardware limitations, that need targeted approach to mitigate.
